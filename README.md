# A Raspberry Ï€ cluster with Kubernetes
What to do when you have too many RPIs lying around and want to learn kubernetes and ansible?  
  
Build a cluster with ansible :-)

- The cluster contains of one rpi that acts as the router while the other three builds the cluster.  
- The setup of the router and cluster nodes are done via Ansible playbooks.  


## Connect everything
One RPI will be the router that is connected via wifi to the network/internet.   
All RPIs are connected to a isolated/dedicated switch that will handle the traffic between the nodes.    
```
            / --> rpi3
wifi --> rpi3 --> rpi2
            \ --> rpi4
```


## Prepare the sd-cards
- Create the sd cards  
``` sudo dd bs=4M if=2020-05-27-raspios-buster-lite-armhf.img of=/dev/sdXX status=progress conv=fsync ```

- Enable ssh  
``` touch  ../boot/ssh ```
   
- Enable wifi access on the 'router' node  
``` ../boot/wpa_supplicant.conf ```  

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=SE

network={
  ssid="<your ssid>"
  psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
```
   
## Router node setup

Logon to the router node as user 'pi' and install Ansible and Git
```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt install ansible git  
``` 

Download the ansible scripts  
``` git clone https://github.com/Linuxsmurfen/Pico-k8s-cluster.git  ``` 
  
Modify the MAC addresses in
```
../roles/router/files/dnsmasq.conf  
../roles/common/vars/main.yml  
```

Generate ssh keys
```
ssh-keygen  
ssh-copy-id localhost  
```

Install  
```ansible-playbook 1-routersetup.yml```  
reboot

Verify that the nodes gets an IP via DHCP
```cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases```



## Cluster node setup

Copy the ssh keys to the cluster nodes  
```
ssh-copy-id pi@10.0.0.50
ssh-copy-id pi@10.0.0.60
ssh-copy-id pi@10.0.0.61
```  
Verify connectivity  
```ansible cluster -m ping```

Configure the nodes  
```ansible-playbook 2-clustersetup.yml``` 

Restart the nodes  
reboot  

## Kubernetes setup
Time to setup the fun stuff.    
```git clone https://github.com/rak8s/rak8s```  
modify the ./inventory file
